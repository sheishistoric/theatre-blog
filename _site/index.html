        </h3><p>Two former pastor’s kids - Sheila (Jennifer Childs) and Drew (Sean Close) - work the night shift at a Swedish furniture store. Sheila is a faithful paladin without her path, still ultimately committed to her Christian. Drew, on the other hand, is openly resentful of his upbringing. He is also without a path, after getting kicked out of his band and stuck performing at local open-mic performances. And then there’s Val (Joliet Harris), the God (or god-like) omniscient and omnipresent manager for the night shift. Sheila and Drew learn to work together and find themselves with (or without) faith to guide them onto a new path.</p>

X, left nameless on the night of his naming, grows up in Nigeria and relays his twenty-five years to the audience. Y, given a name though never to us, grows up a Nigerian-born Londoner. Keith Illidge masterfully plays both brothers, in addition to 11 different characters throughout the show, each one a distinct personality, movement, and voice. For a place of magic and mythology, the performance makes Nigeria - both young and old, new and same, come alive.</p>

I usually recommend reading the notes in the playbill before the show, but I’m going to suggest you don’t here. The writer’s note doesn’t spoil anything per se, but if you read it at the beginning and then think about it as the show’s direction becomes clear, it does. And I wonder if the show would’ve felt more - something - if I hadn’t.</p>

  <li>I didn’t love the set at first, but after hearing the cast explain it I did appreciate it.</li>
  <li>I wish the cast was a little bit bigger, so that we didn’t people doubling roles.</li>
  <li>Mostly came to see this so I could see “Opening Doors”, which is one of my favorite songs ever. I loved how all of this was staged.</li>
  <li>I also liked how cast members sat around the stage, watching over Frank as his life moved on. It reminded me a lot of <em>Hamilton</em>’s staging.</li>
  <li>Still feels rushed (streamlined is the word critics used) - is that the show or the actors?</li>
  <li>My other favorite song in this show, “Franklin Shepherd Inc.”, was performed beautifully by Manu Narayan.</li>
  <li>The added scene with Beth’s parents felt very off - not sure why they chose to include it?</li>
  <li>Didn’t get the joke about Evelyn until much much later.</li>
  <li>This is one of my favorite shows ever (and maybe my favorite Sondheim), so I’m really glad I’ve finally seen a performance of the show no one can get quite right.</li>

I’m not usually a fan of comedies, but this one was an enjoyable evening! Bob’s wild life - in five acts, mind you - doesn’t really do anything or satirize anything. It’s just a story of an Everyman taken a bit too far.</p>

Just all of it. The set is incredible, the actors had me captivated, the spiritual awakening to the City of Bones truly takes your breath away. I went in knowing nothing and had to take a moment before leaving, just to regain composure. I want to read this script and see how much of this dependent on the cast and crew and how much of this is just Wilson being Wilson.</p>

I feel about opera the way most people feel about musicals - why does this need to be sung? While Britton’s score is beautiful and all the performers have great voices (shout out to the boys playing Tytania’s attendants), it didn’t add anything to the story for me.</p>

I feel like the build-up for this show is much more than the show itself. It’s hard for me to figure out where <em>The Vagina Monologues</em> fits into my understanding of empowerment and the movement to prevent violence against women in this time, with the show feeling very dated and newer references to transwomen or international perspectives feel very shoe-horned in.</p>

I mostly wanted to see this for its site specific performance at the African American Museum of Philadelphia. The 11 exhibits (sketches) of the play, as spaced throughout the museum, brought Wolfe’s goal in naming this <em>museum</em> to light.

I’ve never seen a show like this before - with a different actor performing each night, knowing nothing about the script. Pearce Bunting as the Hypnotist was phenomenal, and Benjamin Camp as the second actor made the uncomfortableness of the story and of a new script truly shine through.</p>

  <li>I stan for Joe Wilson Jr. Really going to miss seeing him in things.</li>
