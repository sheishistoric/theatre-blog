The performers made really great use of such a small space - the show is intimate by nature, and making the audience a part of the union meeting made total sense. Can’t wait for another Ignoble Artists production - the audience interaction and post-show discussion were well done.</p>

I usually recommend reading the notes in the playbill before the show, but I’m going to suggest you don’t here. The writer’s note doesn’t spoil anything per se, but if you read it at the beginning and then think about it as the show’s direction becomes clear, it does. And I wonder if the show would’ve felt more - something - if I hadn’t.</p>

        </h3><p>My sides hurt from laughing too much - which, for a show about abortion and everything surrounding the procedure, is hard to process. The musical numbers are fantastic and funny - the cold, sterile moments in the abortion clinic are sobering.</p>

  <li>I didn’t love the set at first, but after hearing the cast explain it I did appreciate it.</li>
  <li>I wish the cast was a little bit bigger, so that we didn’t people doubling roles.</li>
  <li>Mostly came to see this so I could see “Opening Doors”, which is one of my favorite songs ever. I loved how all of this was staged.</li>
  <li>I also liked how cast members sat around the stage, watching over Frank as his life moved on. It reminded me a lot of <em>Hamilton</em>’s staging.</li>
  <li>Still feels rushed (streamlined is the word critics used) - is that the show or the actors?</li>
  <li>My other favorite song in this show, “Franklin Shepherd Inc.”, was performed beautifully by Manu Narayan.</li>
  <li>The added scene with Beth’s parents felt very off - not sure why they chose to include it?</li>
  <li>Didn’t get the joke about Evelyn until much much later.</li>

I’m not usually a fan of comedies, but this one was an enjoyable evening! Bob’s wild life - in five acts, mind you - doesn’t really do anything or satirize anything. It’s just a story of an Everyman taken a bit too far.</p>

Just all of it. The set is incredible, the actors had me captivated, the spiritual awakening to the City of Bones truly takes your breath away. I went in knowing nothing and had to take a moment before leaving, just to regain composure. I want to read this script and see how much of this dependent on the cast and crew and how much of this is just Wilson being Wilson.</p>

I feel about opera the way most people feel about musicals - why does this need to be sung? While Britton’s score is beautiful and all the performers have great voices (shout out to the boys playing Tytania’s attendants), it didn’t add anything to the story for me.</p>

        </h3><p>(written months later)
I feel like the build-up for this show is much more than the show itself. It’s hard for me to figure out where <em>The Vagina Monologues</em> fits into my understanding of empowerment and the movement to prevent violence against women in this time, with the show feeling very dated and newer references to transwomen or international perspectives feel very shoe-horned in.</p>

I mostly wanted to see this for its site specific performance at the African American Museum of Philadelphia. The 11 exhibits (sketches) of the play, as spaced throughout the museum, brought Wolfe’s goal in naming this <em>museum</em> to light.

I’ve never seen a show like this before - with a different actor performing each night, knowing nothing about the script. Pearce Bunting as the Hypnotist was phenomenal, and Benjamin Camp as the second actor made the uncomfortableness of the story and of a new script truly shine through.</p>
