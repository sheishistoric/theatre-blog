<meta name="description" content="(written months later) I didn’t love the set at first, but after hearing the cast explain it I did appreciate it. I wish the cast was a little bit bigger, so that we didn’t people doubling roles. Mostly came to see this so I could see “Opening Doors”, which is one of my favorite songs ever. I loved how all of this was staged. I also liked how cast members sat around the stage, watching over Frank as his life moved on. It reminded me a lot of Hamilton’s staging. Still feels rushed (streamlined is the word critics used) - is that the show or the actors? My other favorite song in this show, “Franklin Shepherd Inc.”, was performed beautifully by Manu Narayan. The added scene with Beth’s parents felt very off - not sure why they chose to include it? Didn’t get the joke about Evelyn until much much later. This is one of my favorite shows ever (and maybe my favorite Sondheim), so I’m really glad I’ve finally seen a performance of the show no one can get quite right." />
