    <p>In the olden days, nobody was subtle. Blitzstein sure wasn’t. The vignettes are well done - Rema Webb’s “Joe Worker” was the best, truly brining the house down.

<p>CSC stopped doing playbills, which isn’t cool. Cool set with the oil drums and wires up on the ceiling. (I wanted to take a picture, but could not.) Also, I learned that Marc Blitzstein was from Philadelphia, so I’ll ave to go looking for his historical marker at 4th and Pine.</p>
