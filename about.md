## Me

I see a lot of theatre, read a lot of plays, and sometimes I write about it. I want to direct an amazing show someday, mostly writing one-minute shows for now. I'm currently based in Philadelphia, though my heart goes out to the Providence's theatre scene and I make it up to NYC when I can.

## The Title
"something more than real" is a lyric from "Passing Phase" in **Passing Strange** by Stew. IDK, I might change it.

## Site Design
This site uses Minima, the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing a Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
