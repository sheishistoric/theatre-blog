> an indented rule indicates a change in universe

Nick Payne is probably my favorite playwright because 1) his work plays on my anxieties about time and the universe 2) I like small shows with big meaning.

There's something so real - even without the explaining of string theory and multiverses or the cancer - about imagining a situation over and over, under different circumstances and with different reactions. How would this situation be different if just one thing was changed? If you said the words differently? If you stood in a different location while you did it?

The thing about a show with two people is that every single thing has to be right. The actors have to work together, intimately, in order to fill the whole space. The direction has to be spot-on in guiding them to be their best. The lights, the sound design, the set - it all has to be perfect. These other elements are always a huge part of a show, of course, but it's little shows like these where anyone can pick up on them. And with *Constellations*, it works! Quantum Theater Group did a fantastic job here in nailing the show's pieces together for a beautiful production. 

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- I wonder if it has to be British? I mean, there are references, sure, but the British accents seem unnecessary.
- The little interludes are pretty good - the only one I can't stand is the longing, touching faces with hands. Is that a thing people do???
- It's hard to be super impressive with a set in a black box, but I didn't really get the chalk-like designs on the floor and the wall. I think it would've been fine without.
- I found them both to be stellar in their roles, getting better as the show went on.
