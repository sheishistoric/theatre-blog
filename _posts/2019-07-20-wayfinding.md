> "I'm cursed."

This is a snapshot of a play at a moment in time, on its way to becoming what it wants to be.

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- There is some really beautiful imagery in the stage notes of this script, which is a huge challenge to a director.
- I also feel like, unlike most readings I go to, this show feels big? Despite its very small cast?
- Is it just me, or do people laugh more at readings? Is it a comfort thing?
- It's also sweet to see actors smile or admire each other's performances during a reading - something you can't get from a full-fledged production.
