*Ordinary and extraordinary* - this performance made use of the aerial feats to further rich storylines of being transition alongside that being in transit. As someone who has moved to a new city, I found myself connecting with the missed voicemails and loneliness that we feel in these public spaces even as we're surrounded by people.

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- My favorite performances were *End of the Line* by Meredith Rosenthal, *Missed Connections* by Najwa Parkins,  and *"The person you have dialed..."* by Sal Nicolazzo. The first climbed silks to convey the poignance in trying to get to the person you love against all (public transit) odds. The second used a spinning circle to bring you internal thoughts outwards. And the third used trapeze in a way I have never seen done so elegantly.
- My tweet: "Tonight I saw an aerial arts performance to Dolly Parton's '9 to 5' - masterpiece on masterpiece". Still very great.
