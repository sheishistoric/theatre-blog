A M A Z I N G.
Just all of it. The set is incredible, the actors had me captivated, the spiritual awakening to the City of Bones truly takes your breath away. I went in knowing nothing and had to take a moment before leaving, just to regain composure. I want to read this script and see how much of this dependent on the cast and crew and how much of this is just Wilson being Wilson.

There's also a similar moment in this show that reminds me so much of a scene from [Black Odyssey](..posts/2019-01-08-black-odyssey) that makes me wonder if it is inspired/related?
