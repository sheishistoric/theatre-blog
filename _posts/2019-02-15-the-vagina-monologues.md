I feel like the build-up for this show is much more than the show itself. It's hard for me to figure out where *The Vagina Monologues* fits into my understanding of empowerment and the movement to prevent violence against women in this time, with the show feeling very dated and newer references to transwomen or international perspectives feel very shoe-horned in.

Vedika Gopal kills it in "The Moaner" though.
