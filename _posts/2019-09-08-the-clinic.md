Two patients enter The Clinic for what seems like a routine procedure. But this is no routine clinic. Following Emily and Fritz in the uncomfortable waiting period before their appointments, we learn everything is much more sinister than we may have realized.  

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- I have so many world-building questions!!
- Twisted employees, indeed. They were fantastically creepy. (Especially the woman playing Cree?)
- The headset component was okay, but I'm not sure I totally get it. It adds an aspect to the story, but not necessarily one that helps to spark/answer questions or provide any helpful world-building.
- Subtle audience participation was good (although I don't really approve of touching audience members without explicit permission.)
- Overheard next to me: "I will now be removing organ donor from my license."
