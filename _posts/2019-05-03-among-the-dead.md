I only learned about the comfort women of WWII earlier this year, which I think was helpful in preparing for what this story was.

The inclusion of Jesus in this story was something I thought would be annoying and tiresome, but I think it was fitting. (Cathy Simpson is hilarious when needed, and intense at the most important monologue.)

I wish the student riots took more of a place in the story, instead of just background noise.
