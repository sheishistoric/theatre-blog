## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- Imran W. Sheikh! Was! Captivating!
- Some really key lines about the Peace Corps that don't necessarily come into play within the narrative, but help situate the characters, culture, and the story.
- Don't! read! the! summary! before! the! show!
- I like hearing the stage in readings to just get a sense of how much thought a playwright puts into the movement and staging of a work in addition to the conversation. And it's fascinating to see how much of that actors choose to take on in a reading - what things they choose to embody and act out, which ones they choose to convey through the dialogue. 
- This show also reminded me how much I miss reading African literature.
