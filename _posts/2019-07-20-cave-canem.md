> "Is he a normal racist or a Sieg Heil racist?"

This is a snapshot of a play at a moment in time, on its way to becoming what it wants to be.

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- My favorite thing about reading scripts is the stage directions & notes, of which Leadon has used A LOT. It made this feel lesser-than - not because the script was lesser-than, but that the reading didn't let those elements be fully lived in.
- There is A LOT happening in this story, and I wonder if it'll continue to be so. These characters have rich backstories that is referenced in pieces, and a lot is happening offstage but is not fully clear to me.
- Accents were all over the place - again, not a bad thing in a reading.
