Two former pastor's kids - Sheila (Jennifer Childs) and Drew (Sean Close) - work the night shift at a Swedish furniture store. Sheila is a faithful paladin without her path, still ultimately committed to her Christian. Drew, on the other hand, is openly resentful of his upbringing. He is also without a path, after getting kicked out of his band and stuck performing at local open-mic performances. And then there's Val (Joliet Harris), the God (or god-like) omniscient and omnipresent manager for the night shift. Sheila and Drew learn to work together and find themselves with (or without) faith to guide them onto a new path.

Childs and Drew cowrote and costar in this show. Childs is an absolute delight to watch, and makes the stereotypical Christian role one who all want to root for from early on. I can't imagine how difficult it is for Close not to break character. This show is funny - Childs and Close have a great dynamic, and for anyone familiar with the Church or the path to finding yourself, there's something admirable here. For a night out, the show was enjoyable as a story more about faith and spirituality than about Christianity itself.
