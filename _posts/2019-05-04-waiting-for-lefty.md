Funny how you can watch a show and, with a few minor tweaks, it could still fit pretty well today. The performers made really great use of such a small space - the show is intimate by nature, and making the audience a part of the union meeting made total sense. Can't wait for another Ignoble Artists production - the audience interaction and post-show discussion were well done.
