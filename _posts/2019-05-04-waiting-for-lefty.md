>We're reds if because we wanna strike, then we take over their salute, too!

Funny how you can watch a show and, with a few minor tweaks, it could still fit pretty well today. Its closing night just a few days before the 2019 rideshare strikes/rallies, *Waiting for Lefty* is perfect for an audience whose knowledge of strikes is severely lacking.

Presented as a series of vignettes, the show hinges on a union debate of whether to strike. But we don't just see members of the cab drivers union during the debate - we see a husband and wife argue over being able to survive another day with the racketeers looming in the background; a lab assistant standing up to his own boss; a boyfriend and girlfriend trying to make a future when job uncertainty is the only thing that is certain; and a doctor frustration.

The performers made really great use of such a small space - the show is intimate by nature, and making the audience a part of the union meeting made total sense. In some ways, I found this to be a great companion to the  *The Cradle Will Rock*. The former uses parody to encourage you and see all the problems of capitalism within corruption and corporate greed; this uses historical inspiration to note how much exists even within these smaller situations on a day-to-day basis, from the perspective of the workers. Both are pro-union agitprop structured around these vignettes, but *Cradle* seems palatable to a larger audience while *Waiting for Lefty* hinges on a strike.

I truly can't wait for another Ignoble Artists production. The audience interaction and post-show discussion were well done.
