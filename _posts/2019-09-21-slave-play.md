> Nuh body touch me you nuh righteous

There are a lot of people talking about *Slave Play* who should be amplified or centered in this conversation. Beyond that, I'm interested in the audience experiences of this show. This is the most engaged audience I have ever been to - from laughter to shock, from snaps and claps to affirmation, the audience was responding. People around me felt comfortable commenting to one another during the performance on particular lines or at particular moments. You could see the front row looking at themselves in the mirror, self-conscious as they realized everyone was watching them.

This is typical of comedies, I think - people feel okay with laughing, with responding to the actors without hesitation. But here it felt even important to do so. I think it's crucial to make theatre a space in which we can process our experiences alongside each other, and be made aware of our reactions. Why do we laugh at a particular thing? What is funny to us? What is not? What can be joked about? What can't?

The couple behind me wondered why I came to see the show - they had met Harris at Yale and were intrigued by the "psychological" and "out-there" elements of his plays. A woman a few rows in front of me was thrilled that there was a talkback she could attend. A lot of people waiting for the mentioned Rihanna's texting early that week. 

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- I am very afraid for a moment when this show moves away from Broadway/off-Broadway and into community/college theatre spaces. Not because I think these pieces Without the right
- According to Harris, the stage direction before the final line is, “The actress playing Kaneisha does whatever she feels is best.” I am still trying to process the ending, but like Tonya Pinkins, I like that.
- I really appreciated the use of lighting here, too - especially after the reveal, the physical change of lighting helped everyone process (er, take a step back and think about) what they had just seen.
