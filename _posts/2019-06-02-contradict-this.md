> "He was a dude. A white dude. With a beard".

If Walt Whitman is about celebrating and singing one's self, The Bearded Ladies sing out the bearded electric to their heart's content. *Contradict This!* is a masterpiece - maybe one of the best shows I've seen all year, if only because I had no idea what to expect. Celebrating the 200th anniversary of poet Walt Whitman's birth, this group of Philly queers and misfits band together to remember him as a queer hero of American poetic canon. Each member of The Bearded Ladies recounts their own relationship to Whitman - whether for the overt sensuality of his work, his queerness, his words and accessibility, or simply for having to have read him in high school. But the room's mood changes quickly when one performer brings up the fact that are heroes aren't all they're cracked up to be - Whitman included. But what do you do when **THE COMMISSION** has paid for a performance in celebration? What starts as birthday party becomes a birthday trial, where both Whitman and the other performers are put on trial for their love, their lyrics, and beliefs. The performance grows from being just about Whitman to race, Twitter, cancel culture, and legacy.

I am so excited for this production to continue on its way to LaMama for Stonewall 50, where it will surely be beloved.

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- The Cancel Ballet is epic and wonderful, and I am now singing it on Twitter all the time.
- Some truly incredible songs, including "Daddy Poet", "Too Much Space", "Best Sex I Never Had", and "Poeta de la Barba".
- Was not expecting to be mooned at this show. Probably should've been expecting this.
- THE COMMISSION!!!
- The Whitman Choir/Whitman face was just the right amount of silly and good.
- I *have* to read more Whitman.
