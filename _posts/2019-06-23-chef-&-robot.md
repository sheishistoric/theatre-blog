It's not fair to review a work-in-progress or just a reading. But this was so good I saw it twice!

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- Appreciated that there were two nonbinary characters (or, at the very least, two characters with unspecified gender) *AND* that only one of those characters was the robot.
- There are a lot of takes on "robot-as-human", and that's present here, but it's not the focus of the story? If anything, it's a premise that the characters have (somewhat) moved past.
- This show has all my favorite things: robots! food! technological innovation! serious story! I can't wait to see where it goes.
