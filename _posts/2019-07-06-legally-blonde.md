## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- I was in this show in high school, so I still know every word. The man next to me commented that I was smiling throughout the whole first act.
- Emmett really stood out for me, in a good way.
- The references are *really* outdated - Richard Simmons, Malibu, "You're Fired!" It didn't feel that way in 2012, though I suppose most of the references went over my head? This time they stuck out like a sore thumb.
- Another thing I didn't realize before - the songs all sound *really* similar. Which, sure - they are all in the same show, and there should be some unity. But it felt repetitive by the end.
- Shout out to the one ensemble member wearing a Red Sox cap. Someone was paying attention to the fact that this show takes place in MASSACHUSETTS.
- The ensemble in general was exciting to watch - everyone was truly committed to their characters.
