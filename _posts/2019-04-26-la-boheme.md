Shout to the two women behind me who pointed out all the similarities to *RENT* ("Light My Candle" is almost the exact same) and the couple beside me who gave accurate reviews of the show. The set uses Impressionist art, which I've seen employed better elsewhere.

Probably going to avoid the opera in the future, though the orchestra is amazing.
