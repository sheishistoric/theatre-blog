As a follow up to [*Cana of Galilee*](/2019-02-15-cana-of-galilee), I wanted to see this production. I came out of it feeling much the same as I did the last - it feels very much like a snapshot in a moment of time, where characters feel like real people and the show doesn't necessarily go anywhere but you do feel as though something has happened.
Someone pre-show mentioned that John Rosenberg's plays were "dialogue-heavy" - which, yes. But it also feels real, in a way that *Gilmore Girls*'s fast-talking feels real. People talk like that, dropping points in a conversation and avoiding topics or poorly hiding their feelings. 

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- More plays in museums! It's a really good setting!
- Also a big fan of Osiris Zuniga's work!
- Laura Sukonick gives me Busy Phillips vibes (probably because I'm watching too much *Dawson's Creek*)
