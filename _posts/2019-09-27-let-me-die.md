> Lasciatemi morire

Part stand-up comedy, part devastating tragedy, part revue, this ensemble performances takes us through the canon of tragic opera at its climax - death.

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- 75% of opera deaths are women, apparently.
- Keckler dies halfway(?) through the piece, and remains onstage. And then the ensemble performs deaths in celebration of him. Fantastic.
- The last ten minutes were thrilling, and a good way to think about the cyclical nature of opera and death and operatic death as spectacle.
