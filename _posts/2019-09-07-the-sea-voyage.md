> A delightful romp at sea

I'm not sure why I picked this show, but it was enjoyable! A dangerous storm strands some pirates on an island with a castaway and a cast of women. Hilarity and some cool sword fights ensue. A good reminder of English dramatists outside of Shakespeare, and decent comedy.

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- Props to the sound design - that storm was awesome!
- Shout out to Yajaira Paredes and Nathan Foley!
- The best part of this production was watching all of the people outside, pressing their faces against the glass to watch all the action. Little kids with ice cream, couples strolling down the pier - all pretty funny and engaging. I kinda wish I could see the show again from their perspective.
