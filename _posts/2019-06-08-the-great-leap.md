## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- CONNIE! Bi Jean Ngo has barely anything to do here, but I was thrilled to see her again after *Among the Dead* last month.
- Plot holes? Connections? Why?
- The racism and corny jokes were a bit too much.
- The ending, while powerful, feels a bit too much like "insert history here."
- Sounds substituting for set...
- Would've been nice to see them play even a little basketball. Like just once. Just one shot please? By someone?
- The game scene was probably my favorite, though it totally broke the conventions established by the play.
