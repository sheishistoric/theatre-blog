Student plays are so weird, I love them.

*Antihistamine*: There were 3 different plotlines happening in this 20-minute show, which seems like an awful lot to smush together in that short period of time. But the references to climate change, millenial living, and Miami nightlife were fun. Shout out to Asa R-W as Darlene, who clearly rocked it.

*Boxed: The Black Show*: I felt this was the best of the four shows, following a black girl from her childhood up through college.

*Summer*: I didn't get this one AT ALL. Commentary on family life?

*Make 'Em Cry, "UNCLE!"*: A despondent Uncle Sam meets up with old flame Lady Liberty and a custody battle ensues. Just wild.
