I mostly wanted to see this for its site specific performance at the African American Museum of Philadelphia. The 11 exhibits (sketches) of the play, as spaced throughout the museum, brought Wolfe's goal in naming this *museum* to light.  Favorite exhibits include *Git On Board*, *The Gospel According to Miss Roj*, and *The Last Mama-on-the-Couch Play*.
