> I don't think I've ever been so terrified in my entire life.

I don't think I've ever been so terrified during a performance in my entire life? As soon as the show was over, I rushed to the foyer to catch my breath and bring myself to reality.

The first part of the performance - it felt maybe ten minutes, but who knows how time passes in theatre - I could've watched an entire performance of the playfulyness of light and dark. The glittering figures in the darkness on one side of the set, an alien whiteness and movement on the other - here's where I saw the hope and despair and etherealness that intrigued me from the program description. The fucking sound design had me on edge, but its sheer intensity gave it a realness that ushered the audience into the piece.

But with the transition to the second part of the performance, that same sound design matched with a new set had me absolutely terrified. Like deeply, physically terrified, almost nauseous and filled with utter disgust to the point that I felt physically ill?? But I wouldn't leave, of course, but this disgust was also intrigue -  wanted to know where this was going, where the chaos would end. I couldn't look away from its otherness, its almost normalcy and intimate engagement. I was so deeply unsettled by this performance, waiting for some moment of joy or hope to appear that would make all of this make sense. And there is, I think, a little bit of this towards the end of the performance. In the final moments, the performers' relationship to the built or constructed environment no longer causes physical revulsion but invites some serenity into this strange world we call architecture. Honestly, I think I wanted to give a standing ovation just to feel relieved again and not on the verge of panic attack.

There is a tendency, with performances like these, to over-explain and find meaning. And I don't know that I want to - the basic descriptions provided by Pig Iron Theatre Company and by Mimi Lien in various reviews/promotional material is more than enough for me to understand my reactions. If I thought I could stomach it, I would see this performance again in a heartbeat.

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- Despite it being top-billed and hyped up everywhere, I wasn't originally supposed to see this show! My first choice was cancelled and I thought, "might as well see the show everyone is talking about." UH, YEAH. GOOD CHOICE ON MY PART.
- How did they get humans (and other things) to move so unhumanly? Part of me wants to believe certain portions of this performance did not include humans at all, simply because it felt too unnatural to be so.
- How do people move so silently? It was so dark I couldn't them moving. (I was also in the very back of the stands so this may also account for loss)
- Some real Jordan Peele's *US* vibes, which makes sense in that they both deal with the unsettling feelings inspired by subterranean architecture. And Jeff Vandermeer's *Annihilation* levels of creepiness, if the Southern Reach trilogy was about the built environemnt?
