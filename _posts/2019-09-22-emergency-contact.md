The climax of this piece (performance seems inaccurate?) takes place in a car. Sitting in a car is a cathartic experience for me. I've spent many hours in cars, alone. From pretty much the moment I could drive on my own, a car felt like the only place I could be myself. It was private, intimate, and an emotional safe space.

I no longer have a car, and this piece isn't really about cars, but standing on top that parking garage brought me back to a place in time. 

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- Holding a Walkman is a weird feeling, too. I half expected someone on the street to ask me what I was doing.
- I want a piece like this that uses the time-based experience of a Walkman as less of present documentation and more of past documentation. An unearthing, if you will.
