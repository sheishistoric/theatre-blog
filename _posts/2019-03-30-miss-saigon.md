[Don't see Miss Saigon](http://www.dontbuymiss-saigon.com/). Really regret seeing this, as the book itself is as horrible as everyone told me. I did cry twice - "The Fall of Saigon" because the US sucks, and the "Finale" because even though you know it's coming it's incredibly jarring. (Side note, but how did my high school do this show in 2018???)

Score is pretty though, and the voices carried all the way to my seat in the very top balcony.
