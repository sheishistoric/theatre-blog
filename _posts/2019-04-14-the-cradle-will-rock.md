In the olden days, nobody was subtle. Blitzstein sure wasn't. The vignettes are well done - Rema Webb's "Joe Worker" was the best, truly brining the house down. Tony Yazbeck is great, though I wish he didn't have to play two roles (I was confused about which character he was supposed to be.)

CSC stopped doing playbills, which isn't cool. Cool set with the oil drums and wires up on the ceiling. (I wanted to take a picture, but could not.) Also, I learned that Marc Blitzstein was from Philadelphia, so I'll ave to go looking for his historical marker at 4th and Pine.
