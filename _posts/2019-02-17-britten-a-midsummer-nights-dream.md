I feel about opera the way most people feel about musicals - why does this need to be sung? While Britton's score is beautiful and all the performers have great voices (shout out to the boys playing Tytania's attendants), it didn't add anything to the story for me.

I loved the set here - the use of beds to recreate the forest were amazing. Shout out to Milton Yerolemou as Puck, who leaps around the stage.
