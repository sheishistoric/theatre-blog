(written months later)
- I didn't love the set at first, but after hearing the cast explain it I did appreciate it.
- I wish the cast was a little bit bigger, so that we didn't people doubling roles.
- Mostly came to see this so I could see "Opening Doors", which is one of my favorite songs ever. I loved how all of this was staged.
- I also liked how cast members sat around the stage, watching over Frank as his life moved on. It reminded me a lot of *Hamilton*'s staging.
- Still feels rushed (streamlined is the word critics used) - is that the show or the actors?
- My other favorite song in this show, "Franklin Shepherd Inc.", was performed beautifully by Manu Narayan.
- The added scene with Beth's parents felt very off - not sure why they chose to include it?
- Didn't get the joke about Evelyn until much much later.  
- This is one of my favorite shows ever (and maybe my favorite Sondheim), so I'm really glad I've finally seen a performance of the show no one can get quite right.
