> “No more wires inside of me/Who will survive me?”

Philadelphia is one of the most segregated cities in the United States, and its neighborhoods and communities are extremely vulnerable to gentrification. According to a study conducted by the National Community reinvestment Coalition, Philadelphia has the fourth-highest number of gentrified census tracts between in 2000 and 2013.

Camae Ayewa's *Circuit City* is Afrofuturistic perspective on this struggle, in which Philly becomes the eponymous Circuit City. This world, with "Amazon Homes" and host of other corporate-owned apartment complexes, is one our protagonists plan to escape. Their communities are invited to board a newly powered time machine when the time is right, and find a home in all of space and time. Backed by a record player (performed by an onstage experimental jazz band), the actors's choreopoems between scenes express their concerns, frustrations, and dreams for a new world.

The choreopoems (or spoken word sections) of this performance are vastly more interesting than the in-between scenes, save the introduction of a eccentric(?) neighbor. The band is fantastic. And I am eager to hear more of Moor Mother's work!

## (a lot of) Stray Observations:
- The audience didn't know that the show had ended, so we had an awkward silence with some stray claps before we clapped for real.
- Is there a cooler description than "noise musician"?
- [Philadelphia Tenants Union](http://phillytenantsunion.org/just-cause/) had a poster outside the theatre that I didn't get to read for too long, but had info about the Good (Just) Cause legislation. I wish that had been included in the program! Maybe it was in the Circuit City flyers?
